    "WelcomeAlert1": "Warning! All content displayed in the MeshSight APP is provided by an API Server. You have the option to set up your own API Server to have full control over the data being displayed. The Demo API Server we provide sources its content from publicly available information on the internet and is for demonstration purposes only. However, if your Meshtastic device settings result in exposure to the internet, your node information may be publicly accessible, potentially leading to privacy risks.\n\nTo protect your privacy and data security, we strongly recommend adjusting your Meshtastic device settings to ensure your node information is not unintentionally exposed. Additionally, using a private or self-hosted API Server can further reduce potential privacy risks.\n\nDisclaimer: We do not take any responsibility for the security, accuracy, or completeness of any publicly available data. All risks associated with the exposure and security of such data are assumed by the user.",
